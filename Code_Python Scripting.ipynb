Any variable which is changed or created inside of a function is local if it hasn’t been declared as a global variable. To tell Python, that we want to use the global variable, we have to use the keyword “global”, as can be seen in the following example:\n",

    "Def : Inheritance\t\"Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from some another class. The benefits of inheritance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "It provides reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",

    "# Subclassing (Calling constructor of parent class)\n",
    "A child class needs to identify which class is its parent class. This can be done by mentioning the parent class name in the definition of the child class.\n",
    "Eg: class subclass_name (superclass_name):\n",
    "\n",
    "Different forms of Inheritance:\n",
    "1. Single inheritance: When a child class inherits from only one parent class, it is called as single inheritance. \n",

    ">> Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class. \n",
    "> The version of a method that is executed will be determined by the object that is used to invoke it. If an object of a parent class is used to invoke the method, then the version in the parent class will be executed, but if an object of the subclass is used to invoke the method, then the version in the child class will be executed. In other words, it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable) that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.\n",

    "In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. However, \n",
    "it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. \n",

    "In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. \n",

    "\"Polymorphism with a Function and objects:\n",
    "\"\t\"It is also possible to create a function that can take any object, allowing for polymorphism. In this example, let’s create a function called “func()” which will take an object which we will name “obj”. Though we are using the name ‘obj’, any instantiated object will be able to be called into this function. Next, lets give the function something to do that uses the ‘obj’ object we passed to it. In this case lets call the three methods, viz., capital(), language() and type(), each of which is defined in the two classes ‘India’ and ‘USA’. Next, let’s create instantiations of both the ‘India’ and ‘USA’ classes if we don’t have them already. With those, we can call their action using the same func() function:\n",
